    "Donuts are among the most delectable foods on the planet, but they are not always healthy. Donuts have a few hundred calories each. Each jelly-filled donut from Dunkin' Donuts contains 221 calories. Of course, you need calories, but there are numerous different ways to receive the calories you require in the morning that will keep you satisfied until your next meal. The goal is to avoid binge-eating five donuts at seven a.m. There's a lot of sugar in that lovely shining coating. The normal donut contains approximately 11 grams of sugar, but a chocolate donut with sprinkles from Dunkin' Donuts contains 15 grams of sugar and 270 calories. \n",
